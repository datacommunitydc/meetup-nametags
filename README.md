meetup-nametags
===============

This tool lets you generate a CSV file that can be used to mail-merge
nametags using the process of your choice.

By [Harlan Harris](https://github.com/HarlanH) for 
[Data Community DC](http://datacommunitydc.org).

Prerequisites:

* R
* the following packages: plyr, httr, rjson

To run:

`./meetup-nametags MEETUP_API_KEY Meetup-URL-Name > tagslist.csv`

Once you have the CSV file, there are a number of options to make labels.
